Please follow the instructions

Please go to command prompt and type instruction
1. cd folder location
2. Now type: pip install -r requirements.txt




It should install all the required files (as seen in the image).

It may happen that you need other files such as OS, CV2, etc (mentioned in new.txt). I have to make a list of such files. Please install them separately as involving them here may create problems.
To install them please use command prompt with pip install command

You can run the code by running the run.py file
By typing command: python run.py


Inside run.py you can write the path there are 2 images test1.jpg and test2.jpg as the sample images.
The output will be a segmented image  and it will be saved inside test_img folder.
